### Description

UPDATE: NEW VERSION CAN BE FOUND AT http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=41941&lngWId=1

This program is for keeping a store of useful code in an easily manageable way. It creates a Tree View of all the code (or any RTF/Text document) in the app's path (incl. sub DIRs). I wrote this quite a while ago, so there are bad ways of doing things, and bugs, but on the whole it does what it's supposed to. I think there are about 25 code samples in different languages, and you may add your own including custom categories - just create sub directories with a large and small bmp in them and they will be added to the tree. Anyway, if you like it or want to leave any comments/vote please do. If you need some help then just e-mail me or leave a comment here.
